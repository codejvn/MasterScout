This is a scouting app developed by the software team at FIRST Robotics Team 2590.
Here lead scouts can import data via qr-code and this data will be analyzed and presented to the user in analyzed data that is relevant to the game challenge 2023, CHARGED UP. 

This branch has the legacy app that was used at the Hatboro-Horsham District Event. This version has not been updated since 3/5/23, and will not be updated further. This ONLY works with data from the Hatboro Competition, and will not work (and will in fact break) with data from 2022 or data from other competitions in 2023.
