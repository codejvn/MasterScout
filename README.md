This is a scouting app developed by the software team at FIRST Robotics Team 2590.
Here lead scouts can import data via qr-code and this data will be analyzed and presented to the user in analyzed data that is relevant to the game challenge. 
This version of the app doesn't store the scout's names and doesn't display it in raw. This is a legacy branch, and will no longer be updated.
