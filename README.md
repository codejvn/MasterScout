This is a scouting app developed by the software team at FIRST Robotics Team 2590.
Here lead scouts can import data via qr-code and this data will be analyzed and presented to the user in analyzed data that is relevant to the game challenge. 

This branch contains the Master Scout app used at the Robbinsville district event. The only data that can be uploaded to this is the data from actual matches from Robbinsville (so not practce matches). 

THIS IS A LEGACY BRANCH AND WILL NO LONGER BE UPDATED
